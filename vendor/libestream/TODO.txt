- Rename IV to nonce throughout all project.

- Run tests on a big-endian machine (or in qemu simulating MIPS, at least).
- Better testing on buffered_skip().
- Test of sum_mod_p128 with y == out.
- Find some way to test UMAC better. Reference implementation seems broken
when (m >= maxwordrange) on POLY algorithm (rarelly occurs, I don't know of any case, neither how to craft it). Test vectors doesn't cover all branches.
- Test UMAC with all input sizes, from 0 to 3000, generating the input randomly.
- Test uhash_update with random sized partial updates.

- Specialize buffered_skip to Salsa20.
- Increase chunk size of HC-128, to 32 or 64 bytes, in order to dilute overhead.
- Create static initalizator to UHASH state.
- Write detailed tutorial documentation, with samples for each interface type.
- Write doxygen docs to all interface functions.

- Implement SipHash, an ultra-fast MAC algorithm.
- Implement HC-256.
